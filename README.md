# amazon-payments-bi-dashboard
Mock BI project using SQL, Power BI, and Python to analyze Amazon-style payments data.


🚀 **Project Status:** In Progress

This repository will showcase a mock BI project using **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Python** to analyze Amazon-style payments data. It is intended to demonstrate end-to-end data analytics and visualization skills.

---

## 📝 Project Goals

* Clean and transform raw payments data using SQL.
* Build aggregated tables for business reporting.
* Develop interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize:

  * Revenue trends
  * Customer cohorts and repeat purchase behavior
  * Payment failure rates
  * Top product categories
* Use Python (pandas, matplotlib) for additional statistical or EDA analyses.

---

## 🔍 Planned Features

* 📈 **Monthly revenue trends** with YoY comparisons.
* 👥 **Customer segmentation** based on spend and frequency.
* 💳 **Payment issues analysis** (failure reasons, chargebacks).
* 🛒 **Product performance** by category and subcategory.
* 🗓️ **Time-to-repurchase metrics**.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **SQL** for data cleaning & transformation (PostgreSQL / SQLite).
* **Power BI** for dashboard visualizations.
* **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for EDA & custom plots.
